# Android Step Tracker

## Description
Step Tracker is an Android app made to act as both a pedometer and compass. It keeps track of the number of steps taken and the direction heading of the user. The pedometer was implemented using a finite state machine and sensor event handlers. In addition, there is the option to reset and enter step length depending on the user. The app also provides a visual graph of the XYZ axes and a map of a room in which the app was designed to traverse without crossing walls.
